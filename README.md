🌐 How It Works
When a user types a message and clicks Send, it emits a user-message event via Socket.io.

The server listens for this event and broadcasts the message to all other clients using socket.broadcast.emit.

The frontend listens for message events and displays them in the UI.

Add screenshots of the UI for better understanding if needed.
